# Finding-the-Best-Markets-to-Advertise-In

#### **Context:**

An e-learning company offers courses on programming. Most of the courses are on web and mobile development, but also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. 

#### **Goal:**

We want to promote the company's product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement. Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise the company's product in.

#### **Dataset:**

We'll work on a survey data dated from 2017 which is publicly available in this [Github repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey/tree/master/clean-data). We'll use this dataset for our examples.


**Note:** This code was written on RStudio.  
**Language:** R.  
**Packages:** readr, dplyr, stringr, tidyr, ggplot2.
